## ✨ Why The FOSS Place?

Open-source apps are everywhere, but they're often scattered across different sites and repositories.  
The FOSS Place brings them together in one lightweight catalog, making it easier to:

- 🔎 **Discover** new FOSS projects  
- 📚 **Learn** about their features and licenses  
- 🌐 **Access** official download links and repositories  
- 🤝 **Contribute** by adding your favorite apps

## 🛠️ Features

- **Minimalist design** — built with plain HTML + CSS for speed and accessibility  
- **Organized categories** — Media, Productivity, Utilities, Development, and more  
- **Community-driven** — anyone can add or improve app listings  
- **Open-source ethos** — every app listed is free and open source
